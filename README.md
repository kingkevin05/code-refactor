# code-refactor 

## Description 
  One of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers is to take existing code and refactor it to meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. A marketing agency has hired me to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards.
